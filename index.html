      <h1>The Band</h1>
      <p id="tribute-info">Led Zeppelin was a British rock band that formed in 1968. The band was originally known as 'New Yardbirds' in reference to lead guitarist and Led Zeppelin's founder, Jimmy Page's previous band, 'The Yardbirds'.<br> The name 'Led Zeppelin' was based on the popular idiom: 'go down like a lead balloon' meaning to be unsucessful; a comment that had been made by drummer Keith Moon on the prospect of Page's new band. <br> The word 'balloon' was exchanged for 'Zeppelin', with this being the type of airship involved in the Hindenburg disaster. The 'a' from 'lead' was also removed to ensure the correct pronounciation. <br> Led Zeppelin's fourth and most popular album, simply titled 'Led Zeppelin IV', remains one of the best selling albums in history with over 37 million copies purchased. This album was also the origin of the famous 'Zoso' symbols which can be seen in the image below. <br> 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Immigrant Song' and 'Kashmir' are among the band's most famous songs with these remaining as iconic classic rock hits to this day.

          <p>Jimmy Page, born in 1944, was the founder and lead guitarist of the band. Prior to this, he had been a sucessful session musician, having contributed in recordings by popular bands including The Who and The Kinks. <br> A notable musical technique popularised by Page was the use of a cello bow while playing the guitar in order to create a textured and distorted sound. This can be heard in live recording of songs such as 'Dazed and Confused' and 'How Many More Times'. <br> Additionally, Page utilised the now iconic double neck guitar for onstage performances of 'Stairway to Heaven' among others. While thought to be a novelty or unique design choice by many, this was in reality for a more practical reason as otherwise, two separate guitars would have been needed.</p>

Plant's inspiration for his lyrics included Norse mythology and the writings of Tolkien. <br> After Led Zeppelin disbanded in 1980, Plant went on to have a sucessful solo career. </p>

      <p>John Paul Jones, born John Richard Baldwin in 1946, was the bass guitarist and keyboardist of Led Zeppelin. With both of his parents having careers in the music industry, Jones was heavily involved in this discipline from a very early age. <br> During his career as a session musician, he worked closely with guitarist Jimmy Page, with both being members of The Yardbirds. After the Yardbirds disbanded in 1968, Jones asked Page if there was a vacancy for a bassist in new project he was working on, that would later become Led Zeppelin. <br> Jones had a reputation for being the quietest and most sesible of the four band members.</p>

      <div class="text">
      <p>John Bonham, born in 1948, was the last member of the band to join Led Zeppelin. After Plant was recruited by Page, Plant suggested Bonham as the new drummer, having worked with him in in the past as part of the same band.<br> Bonham was notorious for his unique drumming style and is considered to be one of the best and most influential drummers in the history of rock music. His solos were notable in themselves as some regularly lasted 15-20 minutes.<br> Bonham passed away in 1980 due to excessive alcohol consumption and the band was subsequently dispanded.</p>
